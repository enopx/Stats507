## About the NHANES data (PS2 Q3)
In [NHANES data](./PS2_Question3.ipynb), we use Pandas to read, clean, and append several data files from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm), and the data we prepare is prepared for future analysis. In this file, we use the four cohorts spanning the years 2011-2018.
