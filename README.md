## About the NHANES data (PS2 Q3)
In [NHANES data](./PS2_Question3.ipynb), we use Pandas to read, clean, and append several data files from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm). From demographics datya, we select columns as ids (SEQN), age (RIDAGEYR), race and ethnicity (RIDRETH3), education (DMDEDUC2), and marital status (DMDMARTL), along with the following variables related to the survey weighting; and for oral health and dentition data (OHXDEN_xx.XPT), we select: SEQN, OHDDESTS, tooth counts (OHXxxTC), and coronal cavities (OHXxxCTC). In this file, we use the four cohorts spanning the years 2011-2018, and the data is prepared for future analysis.
